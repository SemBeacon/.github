Hi there! I am Maxim Van de Wynckel, a PhD candidate at the Vrije Universiteit Brussel where SemBeacon was created. Together with my supervisor Dr. [Beat Signer](https://beatsigner.com)
we created the SemBeacon specification to allow for interoperable positioning systems and to aid the discovery of physical and interactable objects within the environments these
beacons are installed in. Our profile contains various repositories with tools to aid in this ongoing project.

## About
SemBeacon is a Bluetooth Low Energy specification and vocabulary for describing beacons and the environments they are installed in. Our solution combines AltBeacon with a
set of flags together with an Eddystone-URL scan response linking to an RDF document.

Check out more in our [specification repository](https://github.com/SemBeacon/specification)!

## Contributing
Each repository has its own general contributing guidelines. In general, we welcome both feedback and additions to the specification, vocabularies or various libraries.
